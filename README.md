# PS3C Challenge - Peripheral Blood Cell Classification

## Overview

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally, with over 600,000 new cases and more than 300,000 deaths annually. Early detection through Pap smear screening is crucial in reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions. However, traditional methods of analyzing Pap smear samples are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise of cytologists. These challenges underscore the need for automation in cervical cancer screening, especially in resource-limited settings.

The **Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C)**, part of the ISBI 2025 Challenge Program, invites participants to tackle the automated classification of cervical cell images extracted from Pap smears. Using advanced machine learning techniques, participants will develop models to classify test images into one of three categories:

- **Healthy**: Normal cells without observable abnormalities.
- **Unhealthy**: Abnormal cells indicating potential pathological changes.
- **Rubbish**: Images unsuitable for evaluation due to artifacts or poor quality.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/prabhashj07/PS3C_Challenge.git
    cd PS3C_Challenge
